i learned how the DOM of a survey form is builded

- body = header + form
- a "form" tag can have as childs one or many "fieldset" tags and also one label with a text area and a submit button
- every fieldset can be descripted with one legend tag that is followed by one or several label tags
- there are different types of labels and div tags can be used to group labels from different sections(not a tag in this case) of a html document
- a label tag can be descripted with a select tag and can also provide inputs, textareas and options
