# freeCodeCampSurveyForm

# Overview
this project is the solution of the challenge in the following link [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-survey-form-project/build-a-survey-form] from freecodecamp.org .

## What i learned
i learned how the DOM of a survey form is builded

1. body = header + form
2. a "form" tag can have as childs one or many "fieldset" tags and also one label with a text area and a submit button
3. every fieldset can be descripted with one legend tag that is followed by one or several label tags
4. there are different types of labels and div tags can be used to group labels from different sections(not a tag in this case) of a html document
5. a label tag can be descripted with a select tag and can also provide inputs, textareas and options

## Interesting codes
i learned new stuff with these CSSs
````
input[type="submit"]{}

body{
height: 100vh;
}
````
